# Physics-research_Futur_Preview
I plan to use Higgs bosons to have a preview of the futur. I'm talented in many areas, it seems that I can do that ! Let's try...!


For the materialss of the conductor, we can use alternatives of ceramics.
To develop in details alternatives of ceramics, as we used CG GRF in a c function for the repostory ...
add as we used many other internal schedullers elsewhere, it seems that we can schedullers can be 
turned into liquid metals because too many terms leads to exp(x) !  exp(x) seems to be also a 
GRF memnber. As, in a previous repository, we tried to create "ultraviolet" shading, GRF can be
converted to ultraviolet shader functions, exp(x) can grealty occurs. Then, it means that there are
relationships between GRF to BSDF to exp(x) ! In AI, exp(x) seems to be better.....
(may I use consciensousness of programs ???? , my intuition lead me to liquid metals after ceramics).

Now, we have to think about liquid metals ! Liquid metals can be used in electronics, then, there
is at least one relationship between plnacks constant to ....

Following all that we said, merging all together at the moment, it is mathematically an automorphism
or automorph form(I dreamt). This eems more physics than mathematics ! What can we do with automorph forms ?
Let's try to write formulas from scratch (I dont know anything about automorph forms) :
quaternion > exp(x)     //haha mathematics ! No plancks constant here ! //quaternions come from another previous thing !
h * quaternion >= exp(x)
h * quaternion * exp(x) >= 1
YES !!! We finished to write 1 which seems like 1/2 !!!!! So, why is this possible ? It seems that this will be a formula
that we will have to use later !
Then, what will be our next job ? Equations are done ! Then, will we have to use models ?
At the moment, currently, exp(x) is impossible (stuffs from fatos gurbuz or gulten er)!. And in a latest repository before this,
we formulated that we don't have to write some random functions even if their are complex forms. So, now, as we succeeded
to test them, let's write a very long function or equation !
dirac_delta * ((differntial / Pi) + i* .....
This function, especially the first term which can relate Uvs can be true if we find something wrong elsewhere ! Let's find
many things wrong !
(differntial / h) is wrong because we cannot use it with liquid metals
...
So, now, we have statistics because ..... the first wrong forula is...

At the moment, it will be best to have an overview and a photo of a real physical event that occurs in earth or we can create
some formulas of an upcoming visible event. Let's say a lightning. Now, we have some elements:
- dirac_delta * ((differntial / Pi) + i* .....
- lightings
- statistics from 1st function
  
So, what will happen in a conductor where lightnings occurs ? We have to have a relationship between liquid metals and the function above.
It means a relationship between  log(x)*Pi * dirac_delta * ((differential / Pi) + i * ....
Because Pi can be described as one or maybe many distributed models. According to the work of Gulten Er and Fatos Gurbuz, this distributed model
can have a circular momentum (il peut tourner sur lui meme).  GREAT ! We succeeded to link the liquid metals with the conductors !!!

It seems that now we have to have water as the thrid component of the conductor.
Strange !!!!!!! If mankind can see the futur, murders will be stopped all !
I hope so. Nevertheless, I have to continue to work.
