# Physics-research_Futur_Preview
I plan to use Higgs bosons to have a preview of the futur. I'm talented in many areas, it seems that I can do that ! Let's try...!


For the materialss of the conductor, we can use alternatives of ceramics.
To develop in details alternatives of ceramics, as we used CG GRF in a c function for the repostory ...
add as we used many other internal schedullers elsewhere, it seems that we can schedullers can be 
turned into liquid metals because too many terms leads to exp(x) !  exp(x) seems to be also a 
GRF memnber. As, in a previous repository, we tried to create "ultraviolet" shading, GRF can be
converted to ultraviolet shader functions, exp(x) can grealty occurs. Then, it means that there are
relationships between GRF to BSDF to exp(x) ! In AI, exp(x) seems to be better.....
(may I use consciensousness of programs ???? , my intuition lead me to liquid metals after ceramics).

Now, we have to think about liquid metals ! Liquid metals can be used in electronics, then, there
is at least one relationship between plnacks constant to ....

Following all that we said, merging all together at the moment, it is mathematically an automorphism
or automorph form(I dreamt). This eems more physics than mathematics ! What can we do with automorph forms ?
Let's try to write formulas from scratch (I dont know anything about automorph forms) :
quaternion > exp(x)     //haha mathematics ! No plancks constant here ! //quaternions come from another previous thing !
h * quaternion >= exp(x)
h * quaternion * exp(x) >= 1
YES !!! We finished to write 1 which seems like 1/2 !!!!! So, why is this possible ? It seems that this will be a formula
that we will have to use later !
Then, what will be our next job ? Equations are done ! Then, will we have to use models ?
At the moment, currently, exp(x) is impossible (stuffs from fatos gurbuz or gulten er)!
